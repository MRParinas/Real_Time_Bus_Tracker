# Real Time Bus Tracker
In this exercise, the class experienced creating a bus tracker, a real-time bus tracker. The data was from the MBTA, that's Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. This is their API portal.  In order to experiment, we did need an API key. And so, in this case, we looked at a very specific route, a bus called bus one, that travels between the MIT campus and harvests, Harvard's campus. We were hitting the mbta.com/vehicles, that is the source of the information. Then we did filtering for bus route 1, the one that travels between the two schools. We included the trip information as well. We started off by writing the function that will reach out and pull down that data programmatically. We used an 'async function', so we could use fetch. We called it 'getBusLocations()'. Then we went to write the body of the function. The next thing that we did was that we made that call and caught that in a 'response'. And we waited for 'fetch' to complete. That was for all of that data to come back. And what we passed to 'fetch' was the '(url);'. We then extracted the data that was within that response. And we also waited for that to be extracted. So, we wrote 'response.json();'. And then we returned this data to the calling function. So, that was 'json.data;'. We didn't write the function that we would call run simply to pull, 'getBusLocations()'. This was 'async function' as well since we would wait for the response from the request to get the buses. To make the long story short, we learnd how to use location data and map such locations and created animation that can be consumable to someone who needs it.

So, in this exercise, we brought bring everything together, our knowledge of maps, our knowledge of timers with the map, our knowledge of being able to animate and track data on the map. And we would do so with live data from the MBTA. Many cities around the world were now sharing this information real-time with developers. And so, we could make use of that data to be able to create our bus tracker.
